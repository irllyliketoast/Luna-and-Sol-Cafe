# Luna & Sol Café: A Warm and Inviting Space for Coffee and Wine Lovers

## Project Overview

This mini-project is part of my Management Information Systems (UNCW MIS 310) class. The objective was to create a responsive webpage. I chose to make a fictional café, "Luna & Sol Café," which combines my love for both coffee and wine. This project focuses on showcasing the café's offerings. Through this project, I refined my HTML, CSS, and responsive design skills while creating an interactive and visually appealing website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The webpage adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout changes dynamically based on the screen width.
  
- **Navigation Menu**: The website includes a navigation menu with links to sections such as "Location," "Contact," and a detailed look at the café’s offerings (coffee and wine menus).
  
- **Interactive Image Text**: Using CSS, I've created overlays on images that provide additional context about the café, such as its history and ambiance, adding an extra layer of interactivity.

- **Table of Offerings**: The café's menus—both daytime coffee and nighttime wine—are displayed in well-organized HTML tables, showing the item, description, and price for each.

- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation**: The webpage includes smooth scrolling for navigating between sections, improving the user experience when jumping to different parts of the page.

- **Contact & Location Information**: Easy-to-find sections with detailed contact information and café location, making it simple for potential visitors to reach out or plan a visit.

## Purpose

This website serves as a digital representation of "Luna & Sol Café," designed to highlight the café’s unique offerings and atmosphere. The goal of this project was to:
  
1. **Showcase the Café's Ambiance**: The site reflects the balance between a cozy daytime coffee shop and a relaxed nighttime wine bar, creating a sense of place for users.
  
2. **Promote User Engagement**: Through interactive elements like the navigation menu and dynamic image text, users are encouraged to explore the café’s offerings and learn more about the history behind it.
  
3. **Refine Web Development Skills**: This project helped me practice core web development skills, including HTML for content structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for added functionality.
